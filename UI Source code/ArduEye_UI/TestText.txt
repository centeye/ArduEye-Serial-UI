At this point I have about 15# of steel combined with slag and other debris. The next step is to consolidate the different chunks of steel into solid bars. I don't plan to use all of the steel. I am going to save one of the halves of the bloom as a memento. I will also set aside some pieces for chemical analysis.

I have sorted the steel using the spark test. I have high carbon, medium carbon and lower carbon sections separated and ready for the forge.
